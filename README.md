shriveling the world
=====================

The  "shriveling_world" project aims at producing images of the global time-space, using the third dimension, as in time-space relief maps.
The word "shriveling" was introduced by Waldo Tobler in his comments of L'Hostis-Mathis time-space relief image, in order to describe the complex contraction process suggested by the model.
